            <p>During my time as a Peer Mentor I assisted both 1st (IGB100) and 2nd Year (IGB200) Students in their Studio Projects in pre-production and production phases. While my focus is Programming, I assisted in early Design iteration for a variety of student teams
                to promote early scope cutting to ensure Teams could build a game which met assessment requirements (IGB100) and Industry Partner requirements (IGB200). During Students' production phases I assisted with Programming, as well as continuing to provide feedback
                on game scope to ensure Students' were taking on a reasonable work load. Additionally, I provided feedback on Presentations during the semester to show game progress, ensuring that Students were on track for completion by the end of semester.

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
            <h3>QUT - Research Assistant (RA)</h3>
            <p><b>September 2024 - December 2024</b></p>
            <p>
                During my work as an RA I worked as part of the <a href="https://research.qut.edu.au/ecoexplorations/" target="_blank">Eco-Explorations</a> team, an educational VR game aimed
                at high-school students to ignite a passion in STEM subjects, increase conservation awareness, promote ecotourism and improve community engagement.
                <br>
                My work primarily focused on researching VR experiences which significantly involved the ocean, or primarily were primarily set underwater for the Great Barrier Reef Module of the experience.
                I investigated the types of controls utilised for underwater control, educational techniques used (voice-over, information cards, etc.), and generated a list of pros/cons for both the control methods and 
                educational techniques.
