                Hey, I'm Jake. I started my gamedev career alongside the start of my university degree, after taking a keen interest in the games industry at the end of my highschool career.
                Originally from New Zealand, I moved to Australia early in life and have been based in Brisbane since the start of my degree. 
                Over the course of my degree I have become well-aquainted with the Unity game engine, focusing on Player and NPC control and networking via Unity's RPC calls. 
                I have also worked across a variety of platforms, developing games for PC, VR and Mobile. I've also experimented with smaller engines such as PICO-8.
                <br>
                <br>
                I describe myself as a problem solver who is consistently striving to improve my current skills by searching for feedback from peers. 
                Throughout my projects I have ensured I create clean, readable code that can be easily expanded upon by myself or other peers.
            </p>
