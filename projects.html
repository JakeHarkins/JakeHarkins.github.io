                        <p>As part of QUT's VRES Program, I conducted a research project on the inclusion of an LLM in a modular VR tutorial system to improve Player perception of tutorials and reduce development time for future
                            VR experiences.
                            This research was produced over the summer break of 2024/2025 under the supervision of Dr. Selen Turkay and Joel Harmon.</p>
