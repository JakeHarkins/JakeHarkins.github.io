                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>
                    <i>Alerian Defenders</i> is a chaotic multiplayer party game where Players take on the role of a crew member aboard the Concordia, a ship headed for the Aleria system. Upon the ship's final approach, a number of systems fail,
                    and the crew must work together to repair the ship before it crashes into the planet. Players will take on different roles aboard the ship, each with their own responsibilities; the problem being that only some Players will
                    be able to see the ship's current status, while others will have to rely on the information provided by their crewmates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game is designed to be played in person with a group of friends, or over the web with a similar experience to the <i>Jackbox</i> set of party games. Players will be able to join a lobby hosted on a host device, and play together
                    on their mobile devices.

                    <p>
                        <i>Project Aleria</i> aims to fill a gap in my current skillset to better position myself for future roles in the industry. Currently, I have strong background in Unity development, primarily focused on single player experiences.
                        Within these projects, I have developed a strong understanding of Player input management, games systems (including Objective and Dialogue systems), and game design principles.

                    <p>
                        Industry roles are showing a trend for Developers with experience in multiplayer networking systems, including Unity's networking options among others. Additionally, a number of studios desire experience with multiple platforms, 
                        especially mobile platforms.

                In terms of gaming communities, there is a rise in social games, coined "friendslop", which include games such as <i>Peak (Landfall Games, Aggro Crab)</i>, <i>Lethal Company (Zeekerss)</i> and <i>R.E.P.O. (Semiwork)</i>.
                Browser based games such as <i>Gartic Phone</i> and party games included in the <i>Jackbox Party Pack</i> game series have also shown consistent popularity among communities.

            <h2>Project Scope</h2>
            <p>
                As a project with a limited time constraint, I have taken a series of steps to reduce potential... As multiplayer is one of the primary aspects of the game, I've decided to produce the game in Unity due to my familiarity with the engine.
                This reduces the workload of learning both a new game engine and 
                The gameplay itself occurs primarily in UI based environments, with limited 3D assets requiring production

            <h2>Gameplay Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Players will begin the game with one Player hosting a lobby, either on a mobile device or a host device which Players can view together which provides a current overview of the ship.
                After joining, Players are able to set a nickname, and wait for the host to begin the lobby. For first time Players, the controls and goals of the game are shown, these can be skipped by individuals, 
                or the host of the game.
