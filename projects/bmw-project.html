            <h1>BMW Project</h1>

            <!-- Overview -->
            <p>
                This project was completed during my Capstone (IGB300/IGB301) in my penultimate year of university, acting as a Programmer in <a  href="https://teamacuity.carrd.co/">Team Acuity</a>, composed of myself, Mark Auman, Rebecca Jeffries and Nathan Prestidge.
                We developed a new mobile game experience for BMW in collaboration with the BMW/QUT Design Academy located on QUT's Kelvin Grove campus. 
                Our core focus for the game was to deliver an educational game experience for younger children, aged 8-10 years old, which aligned with BMW's environmental and education goals.

            <p>
                In the development of this project, I acted as Lead Programmer, devoting development to a series of core systems present in the game, alongside the associated companion and showcasing applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                My primary focus was the Player interactions with the controlled non-Player character and surrounding environment during gameplay sections.
            </p>
            <p>
                My other focuses included the asymmmetric networking for the associated companion app, allowing for family members to participate in the gameplay without having additional devices on hand.
