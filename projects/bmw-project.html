                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    This project was created in collaboration with the BMW/QUT Design Academy located on QUT's Kelvin Grove campus. Our focus was to create an educational game experience aimed at younger
                    children to promote environmental awareness and foster a sense of contribution in accordance with BMW's brand values of sustainability and community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project was developed for mobile devices, with a focus on playing on the move. The game features a short level structure, with each level enforcing time limits of approx. 3 minutes to reach 
                    the highest score possible.
                    Additionally, we designed a companion app for the game to facilitate a more family-focused element, allowing Parents and other family members to participate in gameplay without having to
                    use additional mobile devices.
                </p>

                    This project was completed under NDA, and as such downloads and gallery items are not available for this project.
