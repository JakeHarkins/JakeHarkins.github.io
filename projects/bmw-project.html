            <h2>Contributions</h2>
            <p>
                In the development of this project, I acted as Lead Programmer, devoting development to a series of core systems present in the game, assisting other developers with the implementation of certain
                features, code styling documentation, and the creation of flow diagrams to assist explanations of the core gameplay loop, or the interaction of certain game features/systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                The core systems I focussed my development on was the implementaion of the Player controls, networking solutions and Player management to allow the implementation other gameplay features.
                My networking development involved the implementation of and asymmetric multiplayer solution, which allows for family members to participate in gameplay without a need for additional devices.
