                <p><b>March 2024 - Current</b></p>
                <p>During my time as a Peer Mentor I assisted both 1st (IGB100) and 2nd Year (IGB200) Students in their Studio Projects in pre-production and production phases. While my focus was Programming, I assisted in early Design iteration for a variety of student teams
                    to promote early scope cutting and ensure Teams could build a game which met assessment requirements (IGB100) and Industry Partner requirements (IGB200). I also assisted Students with Presentation preparation for a series of presentations performed
                    during the semester.

                <p><b>September 2024 - Current</b></p>
                <p>
                    In my role as an RA, I assisted in the facilitation of Playtesting sessions for a series of games and educational projects
                    targeted towards a variety of demographics. I also conducted a series of testing sessions to build a background catalogue of knowledge
                    in order to form a basis for designing a game experience.
                    Additionally, I assisted the observation of participants for a selection of studies conducted at QUT.
